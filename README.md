# Odin Project - First Project: Recipe Website

This repository contains the first project from The Odin Project, where I've built a simple HTML-based website for recipes. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate my understanding of HTML, including how to structure a webpage, work with links, images, and other essential HTML elements.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a basic recipe website where users can find different recipes listed. The website is static and uses plain HTML for layout and content management.

## Key Learnings

- **HTML Structure**: Created the layout for a recipe-based website with appropriate HTML tags, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
- **Links and Images**: Implemented internal and external links, image embedding, and linked images to enhance the user experience.
- **Git and Version Control**: Utilized Git for version control, including initializing a Git repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub. This has also helped me understand the workflow of using Git for collaboration and managing code versions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- Git (for version control)
